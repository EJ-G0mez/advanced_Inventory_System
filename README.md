# Welcome to the Advanced Inventory System

## This project is a practice program attempting to model an Inventory System of a video game using **Unreal Engine 5.**

The Inventory Systems main goal is to serve as both a _practice and training exercise_ for myself and as a guide for other that wish to implement something similar into their games/projects. This Inventory includes the following features:
* Stackable and Usable Items
* Chests and Contatiners with their own inventory.
* Transfering of items between slots and container inventroies
* Dropping items individually or in stack, the stack generates a "Loot Bag" with their own inventory.
* A hot bar in which you can drag items to Bind them to the hotbar slot
* An attempt of a save/loading system in which your inventory is saved at the end of a Game and loads the inventory at the beginning of the game
* An attempt of a save/load system where it saves the position of dropped items.

This document is meant to be a documentation of all the features as well as an explanation using Pseudo code for all the added elements of the project.
